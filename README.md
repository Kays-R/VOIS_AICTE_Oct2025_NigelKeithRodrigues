## Airbnb Project:  
  
### **Problem Statement:**  
* With the rise of online booking platforms the hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation.
* At the head of this transformation is a pioneering American company Airbnb Inc. with its innovative online marketplace.
* The company operates  on a commission based model, facilitating transactions between hosts and guests without owning the properties listed on the platform.
* The study aims to extract meaningful insights, through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory analysis and visualization techniques.
* The insights will help to illuminate the factors influencing the listing availability, pricing strategies and overall customer satisfaction.
* These insights hold significant for stakeholders of the business.
  
**The questions to ask are:**
1. What are the different property types in the dataset?
2. Which neighborhood group has the highest number of listings?
3. Which neighborhoods group have the highest average prices for Airbnb listings?
4. Is there a relationship between the construction year of property and price?
5. Who are the top 10 hosts by calculated host listing count?
6. Are hosts with verified identities more likely to receive positive reviews?
7. Is there a correlation between the price of a listing and its service fee?
8. What is the average review rate number (stars) for listings and does it vary based on the neighborhood group and room type?
9. Are hosts with a higher calculated host listings count more likely to maintain higher availability throughout the year?
